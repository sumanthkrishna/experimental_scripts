## Understanding and Categorizing KPIs for Grafana Dashboard

### Key Considerations
Before we dive into the table, it's important to note:
* **Data Source:** The specific metrics available will depend on your data source (e.g., Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog).
* **Grafana Functionality:** Grafana offers a wide range of visualization options. The best choice often depends on the data type and the desired insight.
* **Custom Metrics:** You may need to create custom metrics or calculations based on your specific requirements.

### KPI Categorization and Analysis

| Category | Metric | Importance | Grafana Metric (Example) | Query Sample (Example) | Visualization |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Availability** | Uptime Percentage | Measures system reliability | `up` (Prometheus) | `up{job="prometheus"}` | Gauge, single stat, bar chart |
| | Downtime Duration | Quantifies system outages | `time` (Prometheus) | `time - ignoring(group_left(up{job="prometheus"}, 5m))[5m:5m]` | Graph, table |
| | Historical Availability Trends | Identifies trends in system reliability | `up` (Prometheus) | `up{job="prometheus"}` | Graph, heatmap |
| | Availability Reports | Summarizes availability data | Custom | - | Table, graph |
| **Performance** | CPU Usage | Measures system resource utilization | `node_cpu_seconds_total` (Prometheus) | `rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])` | Graph, heatmap |
| | Memory Usage | Measures system resource utilization | `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes` (Prometheus) | `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemAvailable_bytes` | Graph, heatmap |
| | Peak Load Time | Identifies periods of high demand | Custom or app-specific metric | - | Graph, single stat |
| | Resource Utilization during peak | Measures resource usage under high load | `node_cpu_seconds_total`, `node_memory_MemTotal_bytes` (Prometheus) | Similar to CPU and memory usage queries, but filtered for peak periods | Graph, heatmap |
| | Throughput Metrics | Measures system processing capacity | Custom or app-specific metric | - | Graph, single stat |
| | Latency Metrics | Measures response time | Custom or app-specific metric | - | Graph, histogram |
| | Performance Bottleneck Reports | Identifies performance issues | Custom or profiling data | - | Table, graph |
| | Performance Reports | Summarizes performance data | Custom | - | Table, graph |
| **Error Management** | Error Messages | Identifies specific error conditions | `error_messages` (custom metric) | - | Log panel, table |
| | Error Rate Heatmaps | Visualizes error distribution | `error_rate` (custom metric) | - | Heatmap |
| | Error Trend Analysis | Identifies error patterns | `error_count` (custom metric) | `increase(error_count[1h])` | Graph |
| | Critical Error Alerts | Notifies of severe errors | Custom alert | - | Alert |
| | Error Type Distribution | Categorizes errors | `error_type` (custom metric) | - | Pie chart, bar chart |
| | Error Prioritization Reports | Ranks errors by impact | Custom | - | Table |
| | API Success Rate | Measures API reliability | `api_success_count` (custom metric) | `rate(api_success_count[5m]) / rate(api_total_count[5m])` | Gauge, graph |
| | Historical API Success Rate | Tracks API reliability over time | `api_success_count` (custom metric) | Same as API Success Rate, but with longer time range | Graph |
| | API Failure Rate | Measures API failures | `api_failure_count` (custom metric) | `rate(api_failure_count[5m]) / rate(api_total_count[5m])` | Gauge, graph |
| | Historical API Failure Rate | Tracks API failures over time | `api_failure_count` (custom metric) | Same as API Failure Rate, but with longer time range | Graph |
| **Workload and Resource Management** | Pods Total Count | Tracks workload size | `kube_pod_status_phase` (Prometheus) | `count(kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Running"})` | Graph, single stat |
| | Pod Status | Monitors pod health | `kube_pod_status_phase` (Prometheus) | `count(kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Pending"})`, `count(kube_pod_status_phase{phase="Running"})`, etc. | Graph, table |
| | Job Analysis | Evaluates job performance | Custom or job-specific metrics | - | Graph, table |
| **Cluster and Infrastructure** | Load Balancer Metrics | Monitors load balancer health and performance | Cloud provider metrics or load balancer metrics | - | Graph, single stat |
| | Compute Metrics | Tracks compute resource usage | Cloud provider metrics | - | Graph, heatmap |
| | Cluster Health | Assesses overall cluster health | `kube_node_status_condition` (Prometheus) | `count(kube_node_status_condition{status="true"}) / count(kube_node_status_condition)` | Gauge, graph |
