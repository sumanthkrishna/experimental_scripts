### Notes:
1. **Struck-Off KPIs**: Redundant KPIs like "Historical Capacity" and "Peak Load Time" were removed as their information is covered in other KPIs.
2. **Visualization Choices**: Visualization types should be selected based on the audience and the nature of the data. Time-series graphs are ideal for trend analysis, while single stat panels are good for current values.
3. **PromQL Queries**: The provided queries are examples and may need adjustment based on your specific setup and metrics.

This table provides a structured approach to monitor your services using Grafana, focusing on meaningful KPIs and optimal visualizations.
